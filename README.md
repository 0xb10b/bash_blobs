Personnalised scripts for quality of life.

1) Change the `hostname` and `interface` configs `anon_template.conf` and rename the file `anon.conf`.
2) From the bash_blobs folder, run `sudo ./place_bins` to chmod and cp the scripts in the right spots.
3) From anywhere, run `sudo anonymise` to start a session and `sudo deanonymise` to end it
